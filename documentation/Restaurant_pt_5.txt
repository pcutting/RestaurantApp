Part Five: Categories
---------------------

The first request in your workflow is to display the menu categories. How will
each view in your menu look? How will you identify the views so you can use
them in code?

Basic Setup
-----------

Create a new layout file for your category ViewHolder. All you need to do is
display a single string. So, add a TextView to the layout. You will also need
to make other changes to layout to ensure it looks correct when displayed to
the user.

Next, create a ListAdapter to display the categories.

Once the adapter has been created, in your category fragment make sure you properly
attach the adapter to the RecyclerView in the fragments view. (if you have not
set up the fragment, now is a good time to do this)

When your fragment first loads, you will need to request the categories from
the server. Once you have the list, submit it to the ListAdapter. (Note: don't
forget we used a callback to get the data from the server)

Build and run your app with the server running. You should see a list of the
categories that you defined back in menu.json.

Pass Category Data
------------------

When the user taps a view with a category name, it will send the user to the
Menu screen, which currently displays an empty RecyclerView. To make a network
request on that next screen, you'll use factory method to pass the appropriate
data.

Open the Menu Fragment. Create a companion object that takes in the category
and constructs the fragment:

class MenuFragment : Fragment(R.layout.fragment_menu) {

  companion object {
    private const val CATEGORY = "CATEGORY"

    fun newInstance(category: String): MenuFragment {
      val bundle = Bundle().apply {
        putString(CATEGORY, category)
      }
      return MenuFragment().apply {
        setArguments(bundle)
      }
    }
  }
}

Now, add an onClickListener to the ListAdapter you've created. When a user taps
on one of the categories, create a new instance of the MenuFragment and swap
out the fragments in your activity. (this will be a stretch for you)
