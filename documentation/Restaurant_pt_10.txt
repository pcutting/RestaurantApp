Wrap Up
-------

Congratulations! This guided project required a lot of knowledge and setup to
work with the server. You also created more fragments than in any app you've
built in this course. By now, you should feel very comfortable with passing data
between activities and fragments and working with data that's not stored locally
on the device.

As you build larger and more complex apps, you have more things to consider, such
as how data is stored and where to keep network request logic. If you need more
explanation about asynchronous requests, queues, and updating the user interface
with server data, you can always reread the applicable lessons in this unit.

Stretch Goals
-------------

 * In each network request, add error handling that will inform the user if the
   app is unable to retrieve data from the server. You'll probably want to modify
   the completion block of your fetch methods to include an Error object so that
   your fragments can take appropriate action.

 * Create a local notification that's displayed 10 minutes before the order will
   be ready. For example, if the order will take 30 minutes, fire the alert on
   the user's device in 20 minutes.

 * Save the order. What happens when the user closes out the app and returns?
   most likely they will have to refill their order. How could you save the
   order info and restore it when the app is relaunched?
